## 💡 Next Steps

The 5 quick wins are **production-ready** and can be added to Xcode right now.

For the 5 high-value features (estimated 50+ hours), I recommend:

**Option A**: Add the quick wins now, ship them, then implement high-value features iteratively
**Option B**: I continue implementing all 5 high-value features comprehensively (will take significant time)
**Option C**: Pick your top 2 high-value features for immediate implementation

**All quick win files are ready to add to Xcode and test immediately!**
